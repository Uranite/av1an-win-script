If you plan to use the target quality feature and have either an NVIDIA or AMD GPU, install the corresponding Vship plugin for your GPU to enable GPU-accelerated metrics.
Run either vship_amd.bat or vship_nvidia.bat, depending on your GPU. Note that Vship currently only supports the ssimulacra2 and butteraugli metrics.

For more information on the Vship plugin, see:
